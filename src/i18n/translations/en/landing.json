    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "What PDF report formats are available?",
        "answer": "The Enterprise plan offers three professional PDF report types: Executive Summary (management overview), Technical Deep-Dive (detailed technical analysis), and Action Plan (prioritized recommendations). All reports are optimized for client presentations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do PDF reports differ from the web view?",
        "answer": "PDF reports are professionally formatted with corporate design, charts, scores, and structured recommendations. They're perfect for client presentations, proposals, and audit documentation - comparable to SEOptimer or GTmetrix Premium reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "What data does the Enhanced CSV Export contain?",
        "answer": "The Enhanced CSV Export includes 20+ data fields: Core Web Vitals, performance scores, marketing tools, technology stack, security assessment, SEO metrics, meta tags, and much more. Ideal for CRM integration and data analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "How exactly does the domain analysis work?",
        "answer": "DomainAudit Pro uses Google APIs (PageSpeed Insights, Custom Search) and proprietary crawlers to comprehensively analyze websites. We automatically check HTTPS status, performance metrics (Core Web Vitals), SEO factors, outdated technologies, and security aspects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I automatically analyze large domain lists?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The Enterprise plan supports batch analysis of 1000+ domains in parallel. You can upload CSV lists or use our Domain Discovery to automatically find relevant domains in your target industry."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I integrate results into my CRM?",
        "answer": "The Enterprise plan offers full API access, Enhanced CSV export, and PDF reports. You can import all data directly into your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) or retrieve it automatically via our API."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this cheaper than SEOptimer or other premium tools?",
        "answer": "Yes! SEOptimer costs $29-99/month for similar features. Our Enterprise plan (€19/month) offers comparable PDF reports, Enhanced export, and Google API integration at a fraction of the cost of other premium audit tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for the Enterprise plan. You can cancel anytime, and we'll refund the full amount without questions."
